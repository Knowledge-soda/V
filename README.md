V Programming Language
======================

V programming language is a simple programming language, made mostly for practice and fun.
Despite not being useful for real programming, it might be interesting to program in V (it is to me) -
it has some new ideas and it is quite minimal (but Turing-complete nonetheless) so programming might be seen as mental challenge (it is far from Brainf\*\*k though).

To use and install V, you need C compiler (*gcc* is recommended), NASM and GNU Make (you can manually compile but it's tedious).

To install V:
  - clone source code (`git clone`)
  - `make main`

To compile some program *name_of_program.v* type `./run.sh name_of_program`.

V was tested on Linux. It should work on Windows but you need to change [the script](Documentation/script.md).

If you want to try programming, follow the [Tutorial](Documentation/tutorial.md).

Contributions and suggestions are welcome, although I probably won't update this programming language many times (feel free to take my place).

If you need some help or additional info or you just want to comment, mail me `jakov.manjkas@gmail.com` (it may take some time to respond).
